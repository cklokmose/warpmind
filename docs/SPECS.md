This is a library for easy use of the OpenAI API for students. The library should be easily embeddable in a simple webpage.
It uses an OpenAI proxy with our own API keys, so it should use openai.js but make sure to add api-key to the header of all requests.

It should be possible for the students to exploit multi-modality with images and sound.
