# Streaming Audio Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The textToSpeech and speechToText streaming features have been successfully implemented in WarpMind library. This document summarizes the implementation and testing.

## Implemented Features

### Text-to-Speech Streaming
✅ **Completed Features:**
- Added `options.stream` parameter (boolean) to enable streaming mode
- Added `options.onChunk` callback function to receive audio chunks in real-time
- Stream binary chunks from `/audio/speech` endpoint with `stream: true`
- Automatic format optimization (defaults to opus for streaming)
- Full backward compatibility with existing non-streaming mode
- Comprehensive error handling and timeout support

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const audioBlob = await warpmind.textToSpeech('Hello world', {
  stream: true,
  onChunk: (chunk) => {
    console.log(`Received chunk: ${chunk.byteLength} bytes`);
    // Process chunk in real-time
  },
  voice: 'alloy',
  format: 'opus'
});
```

### Speech-to-Text Streaming
✅ **Completed Features:**
- Added `options.stream` parameter (boolean) to enable streaming mode
- Added `options.onPartial` callback function to receive partial transcripts
- Uses `/audio/transcriptions-stream` endpoint for streaming
- Automatic fallback to sync mode if streaming endpoint returns 404
- Handles SSE (Server-Sent Events) data parsing
- Graceful handling of malformed SSE data
- Full backward compatibility with existing non-streaming mode

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const finalText = await warpmind.speechToText(audioFile, {
  stream: true,
  onPartial: (partialText) => {
    console.log(`Partial: ${partialText}`);
    // Update UI with partial results
  },
  model: 'whisper-1',
  language: 'en'
});
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering both streaming and non-streaming modes
- **Error handling tests** for timeouts, network errors, and API failures
- **Edge case tests** for malformed data and fallback scenarios
- **Integration tests** with voiceChat functionality
- **Performance tests** with different audio formats and voice options

### Browser Examples
- **Basic example** (`basic-example.html`) - Simple demonstration
- **Streaming demo** (`streaming-demo.html`) - Advanced showcase with metrics
- **Audio streaming test** (`audio-streaming-test.html`) - Comprehensive browser testing

### Test Results
All tests are passing with comprehensive coverage:
- ✅ Text-to-speech streaming with chunk callbacks
- ✅ Speech-to-text streaming with partial callbacks
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for unsupported endpoints
- ✅ Error handling and timeout scenarios
- ✅ Integration with existing voiceChat system
- ✅ Browser compatibility and UMD exports

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `eventsource-parser` dependency for SSE parsing
- No additional dependencies required
- Fully compatible with webpack bundling

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers with fetch and ReadableStream support
- Proper UMD export with `window.Warpmind` and `window.TimeoutError`
- Built-in fallback mechanisms for unsupported features

### API Endpoints
- **TTS Streaming:** `POST /audio/speech` with `stream: true`
- **STT Streaming:** `POST /audio/transcriptions-stream`
- **STT Fallback:** `POST /audio/transcriptions` (existing endpoint)

## File Changes

### Source Code
- `src/warpmind.js` - Core implementation with streaming support
- All new features are opt-in and backward compatible

### Tests
- `tests/audio-streaming.test.js` - Original test suite
- `tests/comprehensive-audio-streaming.test.js` - Extended test coverage

### Examples
- `examples/basic-example.html` - Simple demonstration
- `examples/streaming-demo.html` - Advanced showcase
- `examples/audio-streaming-test.html` - Browser testing interface

### Documentation
- `todo.md` - Updated to mark streaming features as complete

## Usage Notes

### Performance
- Streaming mode provides real-time feedback for better user experience
- Chunk callbacks allow for progressive audio playback
- Partial transcripts enable live transcription displays

### Error Handling
- Automatic fallback to sync mode when streaming is unavailable
- Comprehensive timeout handling with configurable limits
- Graceful degradation for network issues

### Best Practices
- Use opus format for TTS streaming (better compression)
- Implement UI feedback during streaming operations
- Handle partial results appropriately in STT streaming
- Always provide fallback UI states for error conditions

## Conclusion

The streaming audio features have been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. Both text-to-speech and speech-to-text now support real-time streaming with comprehensive error handling, fallback mechanisms, and full backward compatibility. The implementation is production-ready and fully documented with working examples.
